Slide Title:
🎤 Prompt Jam 2025: Unlocking the Power of Large Language Models

Slide Content:

Hosted by [Your Team Name or Org]

Featuring: 8 Prompting Strategies, Live Demos, Practical Use Cases

Speaker Notes:

Welcome to Prompt Jam 2025! Today we’ll go beyond just what LLMs are — we’ll explore how they work, how we prompt them effectively, and how they power real systems, not just chat interfaces. We'll demo practical use cases that cover both technical and non-technical workflows.

🟦 Slide 2: What is an LLM?
Slide Content:

LLM = Large Language Model

Trained on massive datasets of text

Predicts the next word/token in a sequence

Can answer questions, generate text, summarize, and more

Speaker Notes:

An LLM is essentially a very advanced autocomplete. Given a prompt, it predicts the most likely next tokens. It learns this by training on trillions of words. It has no built-in knowledge — it learns patterns in text. And the way we prompt it determines its output.

🟦 Slide 3: Brief History of LLMs
Slide Content:

Year	Milestone
2017	Transformers (Attention Is All You Need)
2018	GPT-1 (OpenAI)
2020	GPT-3: 175B Parameters
2022	ChatGPT (conversational AI)
2023	GPT-4, Claude, Gemini

Speaker Notes:

LLMs evolved rapidly. The key innovation was the Transformer model in 2017. That allowed models like GPT to scale dramatically — from 117M to 175B parameters. ChatGPT made it accessible, and today we're integrating it into tools, workflows, and apps.

🟦 Slide 4: How Do LLMs Work?
Slide Content:

Based on Transformer architecture

Tokenize → Embed → Attention Layers → Generate next token

Context window: LLMs “remember” a limited amount of text

No real memory or reasoning — it’s just highly sophisticated pattern matching

Speaker Notes:

The LLM doesn’t "understand" like humans do — it analyzes patterns in words and builds statistical models of language. The more precise your prompt, the better the result. This is why prompting is an essential skill.

🟦 Slide 5: What is Prompting?
Slide Content:

Prompting = How we communicate with an LLM
Types:

Zero-shot: Give task directly

Few-shot: Include examples

Chain-of-thought: Ask it to reason step by step

Role prompting: “You are a financial expert…”

Speaker Notes:

Think of prompting as programming in English. A good prompt can completely change the quality of the result. We can also instruct LLMs to take on specific roles, explain logic, or follow formats.

🟦 Slide 6: Why Prompting Matters
Slide Content:
✔️ Better outputs
✔️ Faster results
✔️ Control format
✔️ Reduce hallucination
✔️ Power custom workflows and tools

Speaker Notes:

Prompting isn't just chatting — it's how you shape the model’s behavior. Whether you're building a chatbot, generating tests, or automating documentation, prompting is what gives you control.

🟦 Slide 7: 8 Prompting Techniques
Slide Content:

Type	Description
UI Prompting	Natural language via chat
API Prompting	Programmatic prompting
Chaining	Multi-step prompt workflows
Templates	Reusable prompt logic
Agents	Autonomous LLM behavior
RAG	Adds knowledge base context
Embedded	Hidden inside tools
Meta-prompting	LLMs improve their own prompts

Speaker Notes:

Prompting has evolved. Some prompts live in code, some chain together across tasks, and others use tools like agents or document retrieval. You don't just chat — you architect smart systems around the LLM.

🟦 Slide 8: Prompting In Production
Slide Content:
Real-world usage:

Prompting in API calls

Extracting info from documents

Validating business data

Workflow orchestration

Internal copilots

Speaker Notes:

Enterprises use prompting behind the scenes: auto-generating Jira tickets, validating invoices, summarizing documents. Let’s move from theory into action — live demos are next.
