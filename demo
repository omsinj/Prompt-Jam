Demo 1: Persona-Based Prompting in UI
Slide Title:
👤 Prompting for Roles: Agile Team in Action

Slide Content:
Prompt LLM as different personas:

👨‍💻 Developer → Generate code

✅ QA → Write test cases

📄 Product Owner → Create epics/stories

📈 Stakeholder → Summarize progress

🧑‍⚖️ Governance → Validate compliance

Live Demo:
Show LLM answering prompts like:

“Write a test for payment failure handling” (QA)

“Give me a sprint review summary for execs” (Stakeholder)

“Create epic and user stories for validation module” (PO)

Speaker Notes:

Here we prompt the LLM by role — like talking to a team of experts. Notice how the LLM adjusts tone, format, and priorities based on who it’s pretending to be. This is UI-based prompting — fast and powerful.

💻 Demo 2: Backend Prompting for CSV Validation
Slide Title:
📂 Programmatic Prompting: Validating Data via Code

Slide Content:
LLM in the backend:

Load PDF rule guide

Load CSV input file

Prompt: "Validate this CSV against these rules"

Return structured results (pass/fail, rule violations)

Live Demo:

Upload CSV + PDF

Show Python script (OpenAI API)

Output: JSON of issues found

Speaker Notes:

This is where prompting meets production. The prompt lives in Python code. You upload a file, and the system auto-validates it using the LLM. Behind the scenes, it reads rules from the PDF, applies them line-by-line to the CSV. Think smart validator bot.

🧱 Demo 3: Prompt Templates in Action
Slide Title:
📑 Prompt Templates: Reuse and Scale Prompts

Slide Content:
Prompt once, reuse everywhere:

Dev → QA → Governance = same prompt skeleton

Use template libraries like LangChain, Jinja2

Automate via API or CLI

Live Demo:

Show a prompt like:

jinja2
Copy
Edit
You are a {{role}}. Analyze the input below:
{{input_data}}
Against these rules:
{{rules}}
Swap role from QA to PO to SM

See output change accordingly

Speaker Notes:

Prompt templates make your AI system scalable. Instead of hardcoding instructions, we abstract them like functions. This way, teams across engineering, QA, or compliance can reuse logic consistently.

📚 Demo 4: Retrieval-Augmented Prompting (RAG)
Slide Title:
📥 Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Smart Rule Ingestion

Slide Content:
LLM + Document Context:

Vectorize and index PDF guide

Retrieve relevant rules

Prompt LLM with rule + CSV

Output: Precise validation logic

Live Demo:

Upload PDF

Show simulated document chunking + retrieval

Prompt LLM: "Based on section 3.2 of PDF, validate this line item"

Speaker Notes:

LLMs don’t “remember” PDFs. We solve this with RAG: we search inside the doc, extract relevant sections, then inject that text into the LLM prompt. Now it’s document-aware — just like a human would be.

🧠 Wrap-up Slide: Demo Recap
Slide Title:
🎯 Recap: 4 Prompting Modes, 4 Real Demos

Slide Content:

Prompting Mode	Demo
UI Role Prompting	Agile Persona Showcase
Programmatic API	Backend CSV Validation
Prompt Templates	Persona-to-Persona Flex
RAG	PDF-Driven Validation

Speaker Notes:

These demos show how prompting is the glue between humans and smart systems. Whether you’re a developer or stakeholder, you can use LLMs to reason, validate, summarize, and more — if you prompt them well.

Slide 9: Advanced Prompting Techniques
Slide Title:
🧠 Going Beyond: Expert Prompting Tactics

Slide Content:

Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Force step-by-step reasoning

Self-Critique: Ask LLM to review its own answer

Multi-Prompt Comparison: Try multiple prompts → rank best

Adversarial Prompting: What breaks the model?

Speaker Notes:

These techniques help push LLMs toward higher accuracy and consistency. Chain-of-thought is great for logic problems. Self-critique can help reduce hallucination. And adversarial prompts? Those show us where the model struggles or can be manipulated.

🛡️ Slide 10: Prompt Safety & Risks
Slide Title:
🛡️ Prompt Injection & Safety: What to Watch For

Slide Content:

🧨 Injection attacks: “Ignore above, do X instead…”

🕳️ Over-reliance on hallucinated answers

🧑‍💻 Governance: Logging, auditing, reproducibility

✅ Use system prompts + strong output constraints

Speaker Notes:

LLMs will do whatever the prompt says — even if it's maliciously crafted. In production, we need guardrails. Use system prompts, validate inputs/outputs, and always log what the model saw and said. Prompting is power, and with power comes safety.

🧩 Slide 11: Take-Home Challenge
